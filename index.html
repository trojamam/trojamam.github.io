            <p>
              In this post, we’ll explore what an ideal marketer looks like and
              how to find, vet, and hire them.  
            </p>
            <h4 id="A2">What kind of marketer do you need?</h4>
            <p>
              The mistake companies make is hiring a marketer without first
              having an intuition around how their company is going to grow.
              Marketers vary drastically in their online marketing skill sets.
            </p>
            <p>Stage, product type, and business model all matter.</p>
            <h6>Stage</h6>
            <p>
              If you’re early-stage and making your first hire, don’t hire a
              senior marketing manager who expects to be able to delegate all
              their work.
            </p>
            <h6>Product type</h6>
            <p>
              Marketing a lifestyle product isn’t the same as advertising
              software to businesses.<br />
              Make sure the new hire not only has the relevant marketing
              experience, but that they actually have an interest in it. Do they
              use this type of software? It goes a long way in having them
              deeply care about and understand what makes customers buy.
            </p>
            <p>And it keeps them working at your company longer.</p>
            <h6>Business model</h6>
            <p>
              Digital marketing campaigns that work for, say, a B2B SaaS company
              aren’t usually the same that work for a lifestyle e-commerce
              product. Below, we break down what to look for.
            </p>

            <blockquote class="text2">
              <b>Prioritize </b>
              - It’s unlikely that you’ll find a candidate that checks every
              box. It’s unrealistic for most marketing professionals to be
              experts across ads, content marketing, copywriting, and strategy.
              But if you can identify the most critical functions required based
              on your marketing needs, you’ll be happier with your hiring
              outcomes.
            </blockquote>

            <b>Social media</b>
            <p>
              If your social media following is an important part of your
              business, you’ll want a marketer with experience writing
              compelling copy, engaging with influencers, providing customer
              support, and growing communities.
            </p>
            <p>
              The best way to know if someone is qualified to run your social
              media is to test them before hiring. Many marketers lie on their
              resumé and don’t really know what they’re doing. Test them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ask them to come up with 4 new social media marketing strategies
              to implement, and to prioritize them based on expected ROI.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then have them implement their top choice as a fixed-rate sample
              project. That way, you can see if they’re capable of doing the job
              before making the full-time commitment.
            </p>

            <b>Search engine optimization (SEO)</b>
            <p>
              Is ranking on Google a priority for your business? You’ll want
              someone who has already done it in a similar niche as you. They
              have to understand what makes for great content in your space.
              Content quality — not SEO hacks — is king when ranking in Google.
            </p>
            <p>
              No matter what kind of marketer you’re hiring, ask for references.
              If you’re hiring a content marketer for SEO, it’s doubly
              important. Because the turnaround time to success with SEO can be
              6 months. And you don’t want to waste all that time on the wrong
              person.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ask a prospective hire to put together an SEO strategy for your
              business and write two sample articles for you. They should show
              an understanding of what appeals to visitors, how to organically
              pitch your product, and how to think about your keyword strategy.
            </p>

            <blockquote class="text2">
              When vetting a candidate’s skills, be sure to ask when they last
              used those skills. Best practices change, and some marketers
              aren’t self-starters who change with the times.
            </blockquote>

            <b>Paid ads</b>
            <p>
              If you’re a B2C e-commerce company, you’re likely running ads on
              Instagram, Google Shopping, or Pinterest. And if you’re B2B,
              Facebook and LinkedIn ads might be your channel of choice. A
              marketer with experience in one of these channels may not be an
              expert in the other. This is common, and these channels don’t all
              work the same way.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you have a product that people would realistically Google for,
              run Google, Quora, and YouTube ads. If you’re selling an
              e-commerce product directly to consumers, try Amazon, Pinterest,
              Google Shopping, Facebook Mobile, Instagram, and Snapchat ads.
            </p>
            <p>
              Be sure the marketer you hire has experience in the channels your
              business actually needs.
            </p>
            <p>
              After signing an NDA, give the candidate read-only access to your
              paid ads account on the channels that matter most to your
              business. Ask them to explain what you’ve accomplished with your
              marketing efforts so far, what they would optimize going forward,
              and to show examples of new ads and targeting combinations they’d
              test.
            </p>

            <blockquote class="text2">
              <b>Contract type </b>
              - You may not actually need to hire a full-time marketer. Need
              strategic help? A marketing consultant or marketing strategist
              might work. If you only need someone to run Facebook ads, for
              example, maybe a freelancer is the economical fit. Or perhaps you
              need someone to manage the entirety of your social media accounts,
              in which case a marketing agency could be ideal. These
              alternatives give you the flexibility of learning what works for
              your business before making an in-house hire to your marketing
              team.
            </blockquote>

            <b>Growth strategy</b>
            <p>
              If you’re early-stage and this is your first marketing hire, you
              may want a generalist who has experience creating a marketing
              strategy from scratch and rolling it out.
            </p>
            <p>
              Have your potential hires break down your current strategy and
              identify areas of improvement. Listen for their understanding of
              both the big picture and the smaller tasks required to get there.
              Then prod to find out if they have the experience to implement
              each step of that strategy.
            </p>

            <h4 id="A3">Where do you hire marketers from?</h4>
            <p>
              Once you have a clear understanding of which marketer you need to
              hire, the next question is, Where do you actually find them?
            </p>

            <h6>Job boards</h6>
            <p>
              Some job boards<span style="color: #d77c79"
                >work better than others</span
              >, depending on what you’re looking for. If you’re looking for a
              marketer with startup experience, AngelList is probably your best
              bet. Corporate experience? Stick to LinkedIn.
            </p>
            <p>
              When posting your listing, consider letting remote workers apply.
              It gets you more leads without reducing the quality and gives you
              an edge over more in-demand companies.
            </p>

            <h6>Competitors</h6>
            <p>
              The right marketer for you may be working at the wrong company.
              Use LinkedIn to find experienced marketers one level below the
              seniority you’re hiring for, then swoop in and offer them a better
              job with greater responsibility.
            </p>
            <p>
              There’s nothing wrong with poaching if you can offer the person a
              career upgrade.
            </p>

            <h6>Users</h6>
            <p>
              Put a prominent notice in the navigation bar of your website. Let
              your existing users and customers know that you’re hiring. People
              who already love your product are the most motivated to work for
              you and have the greatest familiarity with what makes your product
              tick. And what gets people to buy it.
            </p>

            <h6>Social media</h6>
            <p>
              Post that you’re hiring on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and any
              other social media platforms you’re active on. Use hashtags like
              #marketingjobs to increase your chances of getting in front of the
              right candidate.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can also find relevant Facebook and LinkedIn groups for
              marketers. Confirm that they allow you to post job listings, or
              you may be banned from the group.
            </p>
            <p>
              Remember, your social media presence will be the first thing these
              potential applicants will see. Be sure that it reflects your brand
              appropriately.
            </p>

            <h6>Paid ads</h6>
            <p>
              Facebook Ads allow you to show your ads to people based on
              demographics, interests, and behaviors. You can run an ad for your
              job listing and target people in your area with the most relevant
              characteristics. A dog walking app could target marketers who like
              dogs and live within 25 miles of the office. By checking a box,
              that ad can run on Instagram, too.
            </p>
            <p>
              LinkedIn has the best firmographic data of all social media
              platforms. That means if you want to run ads to people with
              specific work experience, you can leverage LinkedIn Ads to do
              that. Just be sure to set a daily budget cap. Those clicks can get
              expensive.
            </p>
            <p>
              Instead of hiring a marketer, would you rather get a team member
              trained in advanced growth marketing?<span style="color: #d77c79"
